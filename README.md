# NSFWare-js

[NSFWare](https://pierrec.itch.io/nsfware) is a game by [Pierrec](https://pierrec.itch.io/). Please go check his work!

This version of his game is written in [pixijs](https://pixijs.com/)

Latest version can be played right here: [https://magicwiener.github.io/NSFWare-js/](https://magicwiener.github.io/NSFWare-js/) 

I've taken some liberties with certain minigames, be sure to check the original.

## running locally

## Planned scope:
    - port original minigames

## Notes on extracting sprites/audio

The original is done in [adventure game studio](https://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/), i've figured that by using some exe scanner/digger software.

After that all i had to do, was to use [https://github.com/rofl0r/agsutils](https://github.com/rofl0r/agsutils) and viola! Sprites and sounds were all there!
