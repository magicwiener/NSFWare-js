## Notes on extracting sprites/audio

The original is done in [adventure game studio](https://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/), i've figured that by using some exe scanner/digger software.

After that all i had to do, was to use [https://github.com/rofl0r/agsutils](https://github.com/rofl0r/agsutils) and viola! Sprites and sounds were all there!
